# Competitive Programming Club Notes
PDF notes written for the competitive programming club.
These notes are short, and they cover the basic knowledge necessary for programming competitions.

The notes are written in LaTeX, and anyone from the club can contribute through a pull request if they want to write about something related to competitive programming (though I get final verdict on what to actually add to the repository).
